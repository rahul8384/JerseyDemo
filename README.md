This project/repository is for keeping the track of my learning. 
in this repo we learned about rest concepts such as get, post, put, delete, and using database retrieval using the Rest Methods
we also learned use of annotations such as @produces, @consumes, @path, @XmlRootElement.
we also learned to use postman and how to use it with different methods and things such as content type, accept, body, etc.
